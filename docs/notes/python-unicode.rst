=======
Unicode
=======

The main goal of this cheat sheet is to collect some common snippets which are
related to Unicode. In Python 3, strings are represented by Unicode instead of
bytes. Further information can be found on PEP `3100 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3100>`_

**ASCII** code is the most well-known standard which defines numeric codes
for characters. The numeric values only define 128 characters originally,
so ASCII only contains control codes, digits, lowercase letters, uppercase
letters, etc. However, it is not enough for us to represent characters such as
accented characters, Chinese characters, or emoji existed around the world.
Therefore, **Unicode** was developed to solve this issues. It defines the
*code point* to represent various characters like ASCII but the number of
characters is up to 1,111,998.

Encoding
--------

A *Unicode code point* transfers to a *byte string* is called encoding. The
following snippet shows how to encode a Unicode string to a byte string.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = u'Café'
    >>> type(s.encode('utf-8'))
    <class 'bytes'>

Decodeing
---------
A *byte string* transfers to a *Unicode code point* is called encoding. The
following snippet shows how to decode a byte string to a Unicode string.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = bytes('Café', encoding='utf-8')
    >>> s.decode('utf-8')
    'Café'

Get Unicode code point
-----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = u'Café'
    >>> for _c in s: print('U+%04x' % ord(_c))
    ...
    U+0043
    U+0061
    U+0066
    U+00e9
    >>> u = '中文'
    >>> for _c in u: print('U+%04x' % ord(_c))
    ...
    U+4e2d
    U+6587

python2 ``str`` is equivalent to byte string
---------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = 'Café'  # byte string
    >>> s
    'Caf\xc3\xa9'
    >>> type(s)
    <type 'str'>
    >>> u = u'Café' # unicode string
    >>> u
    u'Caf\xe9'
    >>> type(u)
    <type 'unicode'>


python3 ``str`` is equivalent to unicode string
-------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = 'Café'
    >>> type(s)
    <class 'str'>
    >>> s
    'Café'
    >>> s.encode('utf-8')
    b'Caf\xc3\xa9'
    >>> s.encode('utf-8').decode('utf-8')
    'Café'


python2 take ``str`` char as byte character
--------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s= 'Café'
    >>> print([_c for _c in s])
    ['C', 'a', 'f', '\xc3', '\xa9']
    >>> len(s)
    5
    >>> s = u'Café'
    >>> print([_c for _c in s])
    [u'C', u'a', u'f', u'\xe9']
    >>> len(s)
    4

python3 take ``str`` char as unicode character
-----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = 'Café'
    >>> print([_c for _c in s])
    ['C', 'a', 'f', 'é']
    >>> len(s)
    4
    >>> bs = bytes(s, encoding='utf-8')
    >>> print(bs)
    b'Caf\xc3\xa9'
    >>> len(bs)
   5


unicode normalization
----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # python 3
    >>> u1 = 'Café'       # unicode string
    >>> u2 = 'Cafe\u0301'
    >>> u1, u2
    ('Café', 'Café')
    >>> len(u1), len(u2)
    (4, 5)
    >>> u1 == u2
    False
    >>> u1.encode('utf-8') # get u1 byte string
    b'Caf\xc3\xa9'
    >>> u2.encode('utf-8') # get u2 byte string
    b'Cafe\xcc\x81'
    >>> from unicodedata import normalize
    >>> s1 = normalize('NFC', u1)  # get u1 NFC format
    >>> s2 = normalize('NFC', u2)  # get u2 NFC format
    >>> s1 == s2
    True
    >>> s1.encode('utf-8'), s2.encode('utf-8')
    (b'Caf\xc3\xa9', b'Caf\xc3\xa9')
    >>> s1 = normalize('NFD', u1)  # get u1 NFD format
    >>> s2 = normalize('NFD', u2)  # get u2 NFD format
    >>> s1, s2
    ('Café', 'Café')
    >>> s1 == s2
    True
    >>> s1.encode('utf-8'), s2.encode('utf-8')
    (b'Cafe\xcc\x81', b'Cafe\xcc\x81')


Avoid UnicodeDecodeError
-------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # raise a UnicodeDecodeError

    >>> u = b"0xff"
    >>> u.decode('utf-8')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte

    # raise a UnicodeDecodeError

    >>> u.decode('utf-8', "strict")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte

    # use U+FFFD, REPLACEMENT CHARACTER

    >>> u.decode('utf-8', "replace")
    '\ufffd'

    # inserts a \xNN escape sequence

    >>> u.decode('utf-8', "backslashreplace")
    '\\xff'

    # leave the character out of the Unicode result

    >>> u.decode('utf-8', "ignore")
    ''

Long String
-----------

Original long string

.. code-block:: python

    # original long string
    >>> s = 'This is a very very very long python string'
    >>> s
    'This is a very very very long python string'

Single quote with an escaping backslash

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = "This is a very very very " \
    ...     "long python string"
    >>> s
    'This is a very very very long python string'

Using brackets

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = ("This is a very very very "
    ...      "long python string")
    >>> s
    'This is a very very very long python string'

Using ``+``

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = ("This is a very very very " +
    ...      "long python string")
    >>> s
    'This is a very very very long python string'

Using triple-quote with an escaping backslash

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = '''This is a very very very \
    ... long python string'''
    >>> s
    'This is a very very very long python string'
